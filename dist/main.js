Tenochtitlán was founded in the 14th century on an island in the salt lake of Texcoco. Upon occupying the city, the Spanish pulled down its central parts and replaced the Aztec temples with buildings constructed in the Spanish style, but they left the street layout virtually intact. The map shows the new buildings. The cathedral (Iglesia Major) is in the center of the map, next to the square that today is the Plaza de la Constitución. Part of the dedication to Emperor Charles V can be seen in the lower right-hand corner, along with parts of the name Santa Cruz, which is why the royal cosmographer in Seville, Alfonso de Santa Cruz (1505–67), long was thought to have been the cartographer. Later research indicates that the map was painted by a person from Tenochtitlán/Mexico City, probably an Aztec with European schooling. It is known that Santa Cruz never visited Mexico, and the construction and content of the map suggest that its maker was very familiar with the place and its inhabitants. The symbols on the map (heads, animals, rings, stars, and so forth) represent place-names in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The map contains information about social and working life and animals and plants, thus providing both a geographical description and a rich picture of everyday life in 16th-century Mexico City. The frame consists of ornamental foliage painted in blue on a red background. Roads and canals are marked in brown and light blue. How the map came to Sweden is not known.

In 1591 he moved to the University of Padua, where he completed much of his most important scientific work. In late 1609, Galileo perfected a telescope of 30x magnification, with which he quickly made a number of startling astronomical discoveries. Galileo’s instrument revealed that the surface of the moon is mountainous, that the Milky Way is composed of separate stars, and that Jupiter is orbited by four satellites, which Galileo called the “Medicean Planets.” Galileo recounted these discoveries in his celebrated work <em>Sidereus nuncius</em> (Starry messenger), published in Venice in March 1610. The work was dedicated to Cosimo de Medici, grand duke of Tuscany, who later that year invited Galileo to come to Florence as court mathematician and philosopher. This appointment freed Galileo from the obligation to teach, but it also removed him from the relative freedom guaranteed by the government of Venice, making him more vulnerable to the proceedings of the Inquisition. Galileo’s support of the theories of Copernicus, which placed the sun rather than the Earth at the center of the universe, was viewed as heretical, and despite being forced to recant, he spent most of his last decade confined to his villa in Tuscany."},"group":"Science, Technology, and Economic Development","media":{"url":"https://content.wdl.org/4170/thumbnail/1430164872/616x510.jpg","thumbnail":"https://content.wdl.org/4170/thumbnail/1430164872/64x53.jpg","caption":"<a href=\\"/en/item/4170/\\">Galileo Galilei makes a series of startling astronomical discoveries, using a telescope that he has devised</a>"}},{"start_date":{"year":"612"},"end_date":{"year":"612"},"text":{"headline":"Monastery of Saint Gall (Switzerland) founded","text":"This photochrome print of St. Gall (St. Gallen) from the Rosenberg district is part of “Views of Switzerland” from the catalog of the Detroit Publishing Company (1905).

Construction began around 70 AD and was completed circa 82 AD under Vespasian\'s son Titus. The structure consists of three levels of arcades with alternating Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian columns. It forms an ellipse, measuring approximately 190 meters long by 155 meters wide, and is about 50 meters high. The tiered seating could accommodate about 50,000 spectators who surrounded an oval-shaped arena that comprised the fighting stage. On this stage, gladiators, typically slaves, criminals, prisoners, or other individuals who had lost their rights as citizens, would fight to the death.

Prussia, under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, believed that a Prussian-led war of the German states against France would be a decisive act leading to creation of a unified German empire. The conflict began on July 19, 1870, when France declared war. The French army proved woefully unprepared and suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Sedan, leaving open the road to Paris. By September 19, the Germans had completely surrounded the city and begun a siege that was to last more than four months. Cut off from supplies from the countryside, the Parisians held out by eating dogs, cats, and even most of the animals in the Paris zoo. The trees on the Champs-Elysées and in parks were cut down and burned for fuel. On January 5, the German armies began a bombardment of the city, which lasted several hours each night for a period of 23 nights. About 12,000 shells fell on Paris neighborhoods, killing some 400 people. Paris surrendered on January 28, effectively ending the war. The French defeat was followed by a popular uprising and the establishment, in March 1871, of the Paris Commune, a revolutionary government formed in accordance with anarchist and socialist principles. The Commune was bloodily suppressed in May 1871 by French troops under the government of Adolphe Thiers. During the brief period in which the communards controlled Paris, they dismantled the imperial column in the Place Vendôme. The suppression of the Commune resulted in further extensive damage to the city, as the communards set fire to the Tuileries Palace, the Louvre, and other buildings, and as desperate fighting between the communards and counterrevolutionary forces destroyed or damaged many other structures. <em>Siege de Paris: 1870–1871</em> (The siege of Paris: 1870–1871) is an album of 110 photographs by Auguste Bruno Braquehais (1823–75), a French photographer and pioneering photojournalist, documenting the siege and the effects of the bombardment, as well as destruction that took place during the Paris Commune.

The work was edited and printed in Venice in 1483, the only Alphonsine astrological work to make it to the printing press during the Renaissance.

He asks this in the matter: That those who are unable to be present to debate with us in speech should, though absent from the scene, treat the matter by correspondence.

Amen.” The document went on to list 95 clerical abuses, chiefly relating to the sale of indulgences (payment for remission of earthly punishment of sins) by the Roman Catholic Church. Luther (1483–1546), a German priest and professor of theology, became the most important figure in the great religious revolt against the Catholic Church known as the Reformation. While he intended to use the 95 theses as the basis for an academic dispute, his indictment of church practices rapidly spread, thanks to the then still-new art of printing. By the end of 1517, three editions of the theses were published in Germany, in Leipzig, Nuremberg, and Basel, by printers who did not supply their names.

The work is dedicated to the French ambassador to the English court, Michel de Castelnau, sieur de la Mauvissière, who assisted Bruno after his arrival in London in 1583. The book is divided into five dialogues and is preceded by an introductory letter. It presents an innovative exposition of the Copernican heliocentric theory, one going beyond the theory of Copernicus, which still held that the universe was finite and composed of a sphere of fixed stars. Bruno posited an infinite and homogeneous universe (both spatially and materially), without a center, embracing an infinite number of worlds and innumerous solar systems. Bruno’s theories constitute a link between certain conceptions descended from the natural philosophy of the Presocratics with the discoveries of contemporary science. Before he left the cloth in 1576, Bruno had been a monk in the Dominican monastery of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples. After adventurous wanderings all over Europe, Bruno came back to Italy in 1591. He was put under arrest by the Inquisition and, after a long trial, was pronounced an “impenitent heretic” and eventually burned at the stake in Campo de’ Fiori in Rome on February 17, 1600.

Commonly referred to as the<em> Florentine Codex</em>, the manuscript consists of 12 books devoted to different topics. Book XII recounts the Spanish conquest of Mexico, which took place between 1519, when Cortés landed on the coast with just over 100 men and a few horses, and 1521, when Tenochtitlan was taken and the Aztecs subjugated. The story is told from the perspective of indigenous elders who were living in Tenochtitlan at the time of the conquest and witnessed firsthand the events described. Sahagún gathered these accounts around 1553–55, when he was working at the College of Santa Cruz in Tlatelolco. The Nahuatl narrative begins with an evocation of the “signs and omens” that were said to have appeared before the arrival of the Spanish and concludes with the surrender of Tenochtitlan after an 80-day siege. By drawing upon primary accounts, Sahagún was able to capture the astonishment felt by the Aztecs and the trauma that followed their defeat at the hands of the Spanish. Among the key factors that determined the Spanish victory were the ruthlessness of the Spanish soldiers and of Cortés in particular, the use of horses and firearms, which the Mesoamericans had never seen, and Cortés’s intuition that the peoples of the Aztec Empire were prepared to join forces with him to shake off Aztec rule. Book XII contains numerous illustrations depicting scenes from the conquest, including the arrival of Cortés, an image of the Templo Mayor (Great Pyramid) in Tenochtitlan, battles between the indigenous people and the Spanish, and destruction of Aztec temples by the Spanish."},"group":"Travel, Exploration, and Migration","media":{"url":"https://content.wdl.org/10623/thumbnail/1430175115/616x510.jpg","thumbnail":"https://content.wdl.org/10623/thumbnail/1430175115/64x53.jpg","caption":"<a href=\\"/en/item/10623/\\">Cortes conquers Tenochtitlan (Mexico City)</a>"}},{"start_date":{"year":"1247"},"end_date":{"year":"1247"},"text":{"headline":"King Ferdinand III of Castile begins reconquest of Andalusia, gradually ending the flourishing Islamic culture","text":"This work is a compendium of the Latin translations of several works by two renowned Andalusian authors of the 12th century: ʻAbd al-Malik ibn Abī al-ʻAlāʾ Ibn Zuhr (died 1162), known in the Latin West as Avenzoar; and Abu ’l-Walīd Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Rushd, the celebrated Averröes (1126–98) of the Latin West. Ibn Zuhr’s well-known medical treatise <em>Taysīr fi ’l-mudāwāt wa ’l-tadbīr</em> (Practical manual of treatments and diets) is presented here, as well as Ibn Rushd’s great medical work, <em>al-Kulliyāt fī al-ṭibb</em> (The general principles of medicine), translated into Latin as the <em>Colliget</em>. Sandwiched between the two works is a short treatise, <em>Antidotarium </em>(Book of antidotes), which is attributed to Ibn Zuhr, even though this work does not appear on the list of the known works in Arabic by this author. Ibn Zuhr was born in Seville, probably toward the end of the 11th century. Ibn Khallikān writes of the members of the Ibn Zuhr family that they were “all learned men, leaders, savants, and viziers who reached high ranks in the entourages of princes.” Ibn Zuhr’s father, Abū ’l -ʻAlā’ Zuhr ibn ʻAbd al-Malik ibn Muḥammad, a renowned physician, taught his son, who excelled in medicine at an early age while also receiving a rigorous literary and juridical education. Ibn Zuhr’s careful clinical observations led him to original views. He was one of the first to recommend tracheotomy and artificial feeding via the esophagus or the rectum. He was appointed as vizier by the second Almohad caliph, ʻAbd al-Mu’min, and appears to have served as court physician as well. Ibn Rushd, also known as a celebrated commentator of Aristotle, was at the Almohad court at this time and became a friend and collaborator of Ibn Zuhr. According to Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʻa, Ibn Rushd asked Ibn Zuhr to write a book on “al-umūr al-juz’īya” (the particularities [of therapeutics]), “so that their two works together should form a complete treatise on the art of medicine.” This confirms that the pairing of the <em>Taysīr</em> and the <em>Kullīyāt </em>originated in the Arabic manuscripts that formed the source of the present work. The Latin translation of the <em>Kullīyāt </em>presented in this edition contains an introduction and six parts: on anatomy (35 chapters), on health (22 chapters), on ailments (41 chapters), on the signs and diagnoses of sickness and of healing (60 chapters), on foods and medicines (59 chapters), and on the rules of health (18 chapters). Earlier printings of the Taysīr include Venice editions of 1490, 1496, and 1497, with the title<em> Liber Teisir sive Rectificatio medicationis et regiminis</em>. All three editions include the <em>Antidotarium</em>.

A native of Yanling (present-day Changzhou, Jiangsu Province), Chen Zushou received his <em>jin shi</em> degree in 1634 and became, in the following year, an official at the Bureau of Operations, one of the four bureaus in the Ministry of War. In 1636, while working at the ministry, he wrote this book, based on a large number of earlier works and contemporary local records, including maps. The original edition, very rich in content, had three juan in three volumes. Juan one contained maps of the 13 provinces of the two capitals (Nanjing in the south and later Beijing in the north). Juan two depicted border towns, nine borders, and three mountain passes. Juan three dealt with rivers, seas, mountains, waterways, sea transport, river control, and foreign nations. The National Central Library has only the third juan. It has a brief preface followed by text and illustrations placed side by side. The subjects of the maps are rivers and the sea, the Ruo Shui (a major river system of northern China), regulation of the Yellow River, sea transport, flood-prevention sites, and flood control along the many thousands of kilometers of seacoast. Also included are a map showing the invasions by the Japanese, a map of the headquarters of the imperial horse stud, and maps of Korea and Annam, the Western Regions, the deserts, and the tribute-paying islands. The viewpoint and structure of the work followed the traditional world view, according to which the world was divided, geographically and culturally, into five zones and nine provinces, beginning from the midstream region of the Yellow River. The furthest region was designated as <em>huang fu</em> (the desert zone), while the center was known as <em>hou fu</em> (the privileged zone). Each map is accompanied by detailed explanations. All maps cover two half-pages. The square-shaped patterns on the maps are similar to lines of longitude and latitude, but there are no numerical markings. Chen Zushou was mainly in charge of military training and management of garrisons and ramparts. In the text, he criticized the ignorance shown by some authors when recording local conditions on documents, which in his view led to inaccurate descriptions of situations and to mishandling of border management. Chen paid special attention to the long-term effect on the country’s defense of various geographic conditions and changes in modes of transportation. In addition, he expounded on the advantages and disadvantages of the move of the capital from Nanjing to Beijing, which led to debates among officials on administrative management, transportation of materials, sea and land transportation, and military installations.

Ahmad Shah Durrani made Kandahar his capital when became the ruler of an Afghan empire in 1747. The heavy wooden doors of the gate, one of the entrances to the Kandahar citadel, can be seen in the back center of the photograph. Soldiers in pith helmets stand guard, regarding a scene that <a name=\\"_GoBack\\"></a>includes camels and herdsmen who have just emerged from the gate, civilians visible in the foreground, and a boy minding his sheep. The photograph most likely was taken during the British occupation of Kandahar, which lasted from September 1880 to April 1881. The Second Anglo-Afghan War began in November 1878 when Great Britain, fearful of what it saw as growing Russian influence in Afghanistan, invaded the country from British India. The first phase of the war ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak, which permitted the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British. Fighting resumed in September 1879 after an anti-British uprising in Kabul, and finally concluded in September 1880 with the decisive Battle of Kandahar. The album includes portraits of British and Afghan leaders and military personnel, portraits of ordinary Afghan people, and depictions of British military camps and activities, structures, landscapes, and cities and towns. The sites shown are all located within the borders of present-day Afghanistan or Pakistan (a part of British India at the time). About a third of the photographs were taken by John Burke (circa 1843–1900), another third by Sir Benjamin Simpson (1831–1923), and the remainder by several other photographers. Some of the photographs are unattributed. The album possibly was compiled by a member of the British Indian government, but this has not been confirmed. How it came to the Library of Congress is not known."},"group":"Government, Politics, and War","media":{"url":"https://content.wdl.org/11529/thumbnail/1430177475/616x510.jpg","thumbnail":"https://content.wdl.org/11529/thumbnail/1430177475/64x53.jpg","caption":"<a href=\\"/en/item/11529/\\">Second Anglo Afghan War</a>"}},{"start_date":{"year":"-3372"},"end_date":{"year":"-3372"},"text":{"headline":"First date on the Maya calendar","text":"Only four Mayan manuscripts still exist worldwide, of which the oldest and best preserved is the Dresden Codex, held in the collections of the Saxon State and University Library. The manuscript was purchased for the Dresden court library in 1739 in Vienna, as a “Mexican book.” In 1853 it was identified as a Mayan manuscript. Consisting of 39 leaves, inscribed on both sides, and approximately 358 centimeters long, the manuscript originally was folded in an accordion-like manner. The chalk-coated writing material, <em>amatl</em>, is a paper-like matter produced from fig-tree fiber by means of soaking and beating. The codex depicts hieroglyphs and numerals and figures, and contains ritual and divination calendars, calculations of the phases of Venus, eclipses of the sun and moon, instructions relating to new-year ceremonies, and descriptions of the locations of the Rain God, which culminate in a full-page miniature showing a great deluge. The preeminent researcher working with Mayan codices in the 19th century was Ernst Förstermann (1822–1906), royal librarian of the Electorate of Saxony and director of the Saxon State and University Library. Förstermann elucidated the numerical, calendrical, and astronomic systems in the codex and determined that the deities, numbers, and day names in it related to the 260-day Mayan calendar. Förstermann also used the codex to make important contributions to scholarly understanding of the Mayan Long Count calendar, which counted days from the Mayan creation date."},"group":"Science, Technology, and Economic Development","media":{"url":"https://content.wdl.org/11621/thumbnail/1430177783/616x510.jpg","thumbnail":"https://content.wdl.org/11621/thumbnail/1430177783/64x53.jpg","caption":"<a href=\\"/en/item/11621/\\">First date on the Maya calendar</a>"}},{"start_date":{"year":"-334"},"end_date":{"year":"-323"},"text":{"headline":"Alexander the Great conquers empire that stretches from Greece to western India","text":"This 1833 map in Latin shows the conquests of Alexander the Great (356–323 BC), whose empire stretched from present-day Greece through Turkey and the Middle East to Afghanistan.

Many of the war’s major battles were fought on the Crimean Peninsula in southern Russia, which, ironically, is not shown on this early map of the “theater of war.” The conflict ended with the Treaty of Paris, signed on March 30, 1856, in which Russia was forced to give up territory it had seized from the Ottomans. Color codes are used to indicate the Russian, Austrian, and Turkish Empires, as well as Greece, which had secured its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1832, Moldavia, and the principalities of Wallachia (present-day Romania), Serbia, and Montenegro. The latter were territories nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, but which were autonomous and under Russian influence.

Most notable is its prefatory image cycle, which makes references to holy places in Jerusalem, such as Golgotha and the Holy Sepulcher, as they appeared in the sixth century. The manuscript therefore appears to be based on a sixth-century exemplar containing images connected to the Byzantine cult of holy places. Several related manuscripts have been identified that seem to be based on the same prototype, most notably Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, eth. 32, a fragment in the Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University, Inventory no. 3475 a−b, and another fragment in the National Museum, Stockholm, NM B 2034.

Most of the monks were killed, though some escaped, and many went to the Vyg region, where the author of this book, Simeon Denisov (1682−1741), seen in a full-page miniature on folio 1 verso, was a leader in the Old Believer community.

The works are The works are<em> De tempore</em> (also called <em>De individuatio temporis</em>) (On time); <em>De ydeis</em> [<em>De ideis</em>] (On divine ideas); <em>De materia et forma</em> (On matter and form); and <em>De universalibus</em> (On universals); as well as a work by an unidentified author entitled <em>Replicacio de universalibus</em> (Reply on the universals). According to the colophon, the manuscript was written by Jan Hus, an early proponent of ecclesiastical reform, and completed on Saint Jerome’s Day, September 30, 1398, the year Hus began his career as a professor at Prague University. The codex is the only extant large work of Hus in his own hand. It was annotated by Hus, partly in Czech, and some of the notes have a strong polemical character and are critical of the Germans. Bound in limp vellum with a reinforced spine, the manuscript is a fine example of a rapidly written and abbreviated university manuscript. Jan Hus (John Huss) was born circa 1370 in Husinec in southern Bohemia (in the present-day Czech Republic). As a preacher of the Bethlehem Chapel and rector of the philosophical faculty at the Prague University at the beginning of the 15th century, he propounded the need for a national church and the importance of the Bible as a unique authority for the belief and life of Christians. He was much influenced by Wycliffe. Hus received strong support for his ideas from Czech university students, but not from their German counterparts. Consequently, the German students left Prague and started a new university in Leipzig. Hus was convicted of heresy at the Council of Constance and burned at the stake in 1415. The manuscript was confiscated by the Swedish army in 1648, during its occupation of Prague at the conclusion of the Thirty Years’ War, and taken to Sweden."},"group":"Religion and Philosophy","media":{"url":"https://content.wdl.org/14296/thumbnail/1430182962/616x510.jpg","thumbnail":"https://content.wdl.org/14296/thumbnail/1430182962/64x53.jpg","caption":"<a href=\\"/en/item/14296/\\">Jan Hus, Czech religious reformer, burned at the stake for heresy</a>"}},{"start_date":{"year":"1271"},"end_date":{"year":"1271"},"text":{"headline":"Marco Polo begins his journey to China","text":"This manuscript from about 1350 is one of the oldest extant copies of <em>Les voyages</em> <em>de Marco Polo</em> (The travels of Marco Polo), the account by the Venetian merchant Marco Polo (circa 1254−1324) of his adventures in Central Asia and the Far East during the latter part of the 13th century. It is possibly one of five manuscripts relating to Marco Polo’s journey that belonged to King Charles V of France (reigned 1364−80). Later it was part of the library of the French book collector Alexandre Petau. It was sold to Queen Christina of Sweden (1626−89) in 1650. Accompanied by his father Niccolò and his uncle Maffeo, Marco Polo travelled overland to China in 1271–75. He then spent 17 years serving Kublai Khan (1215–94), grandson of Genghis Khan and conqueror of China, for whom he undertook assignments in China as well as in South and Southeast Asia. The three Venetians returned to their native city by sea in 1292–95. Marco Polo soon was caught up in the war between Venice and Genoa, for which he equipped and commanded a galley in the Venetian navy. He was taken prisoner by the Genoese in 1296. According to tradition, while in prison he dictated the stories of his travels to a cellmate, Rustichello da Pisa, who wrote them down in Old French. Marco Polo’s account was not just a simple record of the journey, but a description of the world—a mixture of a travel report, legend, hearsay, and practical information. For these reasons, <em>Les voyages</em> <em>de Marco Polo</em> is sometimes called <em>Divisament du monde</em> (Description of the world) or <em>Livre des merveilles du monde</em> (Book of the marvels of the world). The work was an important introduction for Europeans to the history and geography of Central Asia and China.
